there are 4 types of Climate Measurements:(per unit area)

(measurement is a climate measurement) (inheritance) (base class)
Temperature
Wind speed
Humidity
Radiation Absorption

-ClimateMeasurement: year, month
-Temperature: celciusMeasurement, fahrenheitMeasurement, kelvinMeasurement
-WindSpeed: metersPerSecond, kmPerHour
-Humidity: humidityPercentage
-RadiationAbsorbtion: radiationIntensity, unitAbsorbtionValue

All these measurements except
year, month and radiationIntensity should be of type double .
“radiationIntensity” is an enum class containing these three fixed values: “low”, “ medium ”, “high”

Measurements inside their objects should be randomly initialized according to the ranges given below:
-2020 <= year <= 2022
-January <= month <= December
-40.0 <= celciusMeasurement <= 50.0
-fahrenheitMeasurement: This should be converted from celciusMeasurement.
-kelvinMeasurement:kelvinMeasurement: This should be converted from celciusMeasurement.This should be converted from celciusMeasurement.
-0.00.0 <= <= metersPerSecond <= 113.2metersPerSecond <= 113.2
-kmPerHour: This should be converted from metersPerSecond.kmPerHour: This should be converted from metersPerSecond.
-0.00.0 <= <= humidityPercentage <= 100.0humidityPercentage <= 100.0
-5.05.0 <= <= unitAbsorbtionValue <= 20.0unitAbsorbtionValue <= 20.0

locations:
measurements (ArrayList objects that consist of the measurement objects)

countries
The climate data of countries are used for calculating the followings:
country wide temperature statistics

cities
felt temperature

the data of cities are used for calculating the folowings:
useful statistics with the 4 measurement types for their respective city.
